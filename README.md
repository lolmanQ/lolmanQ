## Improved unity scene managment
- Project type: Game engine extention
- Personal project

Loading scenes in unity has always been a bit of spegeti code so i created an improved scenemanagment system

### Easy to use API
To load a collection of scenes, you only need to pass in a SceneCollection ScriptibleObject
```cs
SceneHandler.LoadCollection(SceneCollectionSO collectionToLoad)
```
### Scene collection
